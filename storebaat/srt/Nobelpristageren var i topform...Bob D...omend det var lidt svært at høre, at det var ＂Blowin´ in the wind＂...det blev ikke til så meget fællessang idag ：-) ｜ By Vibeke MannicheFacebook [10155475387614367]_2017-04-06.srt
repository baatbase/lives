1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Yes, blowing in the wind, I ain't got nothing else to lose

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Blowing in the wind

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 How many years must a man face this

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Oh, it is what you have to see

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 How many years must a man face this

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Before they learn to live

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 How many times must a man pretend

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Pretend that he just doesn't see

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 How many years must a man face this

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 How many times must a man pretend

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Pretend that he just doesn't see

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 How many times must a man pretend

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Before he can see the sky

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 How many years must a man live before he can hear

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 People cry, how many days will it take to live alone

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Too many people have died

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Blowing in the wind, it's blowing in the wind

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 How many times must a man pretend

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Before he can see the sky

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 How many years must a man pretend

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
