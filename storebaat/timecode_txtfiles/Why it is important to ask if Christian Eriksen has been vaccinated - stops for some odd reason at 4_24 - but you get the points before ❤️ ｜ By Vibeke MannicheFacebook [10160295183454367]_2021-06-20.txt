00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Hello to everyone. My name is Viva Comanica. I'm a Danish physician, MD, PhD.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Many of you have asked if I could make a short video in English, so I'll try and do my best.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 I have been following the whole corona crisis from the start.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 The literature, the scientific literature, the data, especially the Danish data, of course.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 And I have seen how much misinformation there has been from the government, from the press, for many odd reasons.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 But nevertheless, this one will be a short video concerning the situation with the Danish football player Christian Eriksen.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 He had, more than a week ago, a cardiac arrest on the football ground in the midst of a football game here in Copenhagen.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And I know that I share with many of my colleagues the thought that many of us thought when he had his cardiac arrest,

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 which was, of course, a big tragedy. Thank God he survived, and now he has a pacemaker.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But nevertheless, had the same thought. Has he been vaccinated? And why so?

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Well, the reason is that there is going on a big discussion in the medical environment,

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 and especially based on data from CDC in the States, because the States has been vaccinating a lot of people,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 many, many millions, but has also seen a rise in a very rare side effect as myocarditis,

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 which can bring on arrhythmia and, in worse scenario, sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So, just the day before, the Danish medical agency Lemensstyrelsen, together with the European Medical Agency,

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 sent out a note for all the Danish doctors concerning the situation with myocarditis,

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 and also that they were looking into this matter. Of course, they are.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And if you follow CDC also, you will see that the Center for Disease Control in the States,

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 you will see that they are also very concerned about this side effect, although it may be rare.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It seems to affect especially young people, younger than 30, and primarily seems to be men, or at least more men than women.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 So, it is of a big concern, because you also have to look into, well, what is the cost of a vaccine for the person,

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 him or herself, what is the reason for the vaccine, and so on.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 So, for me and for many other doctors, it was a proper and very simple question to ask.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 For some odd reason, the press, the international press, the Danish press, has lacked the willingness to put on this question.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 We have a short answer the same day he fell on the court from a doctor from the football club, which he is part of in Italy,

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 and after that we haven't heard anything, which I think is a big mistake, because we need to have an answer,

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 because of the trust into football, the trust into the vaccines, we need to know.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 So, I'm not saying that is the case, I just put forward that very simple question,

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 which I think we should share with the whole World Press Association, because this has such a great impact,

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 not only on football and the trust in football, but of course also to get more knowledge of the vaccines,

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 and what it does to, as here, professional athletes.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 So, let's get an answer, let's put forward that question, it's a simple question, it is obvious.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I'm not sure why the Danish and the international press are lacking their willingness of putting that question forward.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It may be stupidity that they don't understand why we think there is a connection,

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and it may be unwillingness because of many, many things.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I don't have the answer on that, I'm just very confused, actually shocked,

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 that there is such a lack of willingness to put forward that question.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But nevertheless, now you have my explanation, and I hope that you understand why it's so important.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I hope that you are aware that there is going on this big concern about the myocarditis among young people,

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 especially young people, and I think we need to have a proper answer on the whole matter,

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 and I think we need to keep an open mind for, let's say, side effects, for the effects of course, but also for the side effects.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 That's the way we do it usually in the medical world,

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 and that's how we should continue to do, to keep an eye on what the side effects may be,

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 and of course, what's the price for the, I'm not talking the price in dollars,

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 but what is the price for the individual to have that vaccine, what is the risk for that individual,

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 and of course the risk is bigger the less you'll get the disease you're being vaccinated against,

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 and therefore, which side effects.

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But nevertheless, that was a short video just to try and explain in English the connection,

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 and why it seems to be such an urgent, but also such a relevant question to ask,

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 whether Christian Eriksen was vaccinated, and it should be a very easy, peasy thing to answer also,

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 so I look forward to get that answer.

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Have a nice day, take care, and be happy. Bye bye.
