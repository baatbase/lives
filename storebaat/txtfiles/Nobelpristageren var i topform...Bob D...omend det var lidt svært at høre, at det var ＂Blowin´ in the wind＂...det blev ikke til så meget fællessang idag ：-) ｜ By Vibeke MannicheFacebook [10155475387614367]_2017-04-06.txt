 Yes, blowing in the wind, I ain't got nothing else to lose
 Blowing in the wind
 How many years must a man face this
 Oh, it is what you have to see
 How many years must a man face this
 Before they learn to live
 How many times must a man pretend
 Pretend that he just doesn't see
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 How many years must a man face this
 How many times must a man pretend
 Pretend that he just doesn't see
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 How many times must a man pretend
 Before he can see the sky
 How many years must a man live before he can hear
 People cry, how many days will it take to live alone
 Too many people have died
 Blowing in the wind, it's blowing in the wind
 Blowing in the wind, my friend, it's blowing in the wind
 How many times must a man pretend
 Before he can see the sky
 How many years must a man pretend
